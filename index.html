				<p>Created for artist <a href="http://katielee.com.au">Katie Lee</a>, <a href="http://convent.katielee.com.au">Convent</a> was an online map designed to accompany an exhibition set across the grounds of Abbotsford Convent. Presenting viewers with a map designed in collaboration with the artist, the location of the orange points could be easily set and added to by the artist without modifying the website code.</p>

				<p>Working as part of a team, I developed the back-end for the latest iteration of <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanKneeDeep">Duncan</a>'s Roulette Free-for-All app, which he uses to to create popular videos on a daily basis. This new version enabled him to give accounts or one-time-use codes to viewers or other content creators, opening up a wide range of new opportunities.</p>

				<p>Created for the Pokémon video game community, <a href="https://pokepast.es">pokepast.es</a> is a custom pastebin for players to build, share and discuss teams. Utilising an existing text format, PokePaste generates coloured highlighting and images for any team, and creates a unique link that can be shared indefinitely. The website has received over 700,000 submissions.</p>
